# Code of Conduct for Nimbus-UI

We aim to create an open and welcoming environment for all contributors and users.
This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participation in the project, ensuring a positive experience for everyone involved.

## 1. Responsibilities

- **Owners and Long-Term Maintainers**: Only owners, team-members, and long-term maintainers hold responsibility for the ongoing maintenance and support of the project. They are accountable for the project's direction, management, and overall health.

- **Short-Term or One-Time Contributors**: Contributors who engage with the project on a short-term basis will be credited for their work but are not expected or obliged to support their contributions long-term. There is no obligation to continue contributing, as this software is open source and free to use and distribute.

- **Decision-Making & Dispute Resolution**: Due to their responsibility for the project, Owners, team members, and long-term maintainers have the authority to make final decisions. If you believe a decision has been made unfairly, you are encouraged to raise your concerns respectfully with a maintainer. While final decisions rest with the maintainers, we value reasoned discussion backed by logic and evidence.

## 2. Respectful Interaction

We strive to foster a welcoming and supportive environment that encourages the challenging of ideas. To maintain a respectful community, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Assume Positive Intent**: Always assume that others have good intentions, even when disagreements arise.
- **Address Others with Courtesy**: Treat all participants with respect. Engage in discussions in a civil manner, regardless of differing opinions.
- **Use Logic and Evidence to Back Up Claims**: Claims with weight will be more convincing than simply stating you prefer something done a particular way.
- **Practice Active Listening**: Ensure you understand others’ points of view before responding. Acknowledge their contributions even if you disagree.
- **Maintain Professionalism**: Keep discussions focused on the project and refrain from personal attacks or irrelevant remarks.
- **Accept That Things Go Wrong**: Mistakes happen, unexpected issues arise, and not everything will go smoothly. When things go wrong, remain constructive and focus on solutions rather than blame. We will deal with challenges as they come.

## 3. Constructive Feedback

When providing feedback, it is essential to be constructive and focus on the work rather than the individual. Use the following guidelines for giving feedback:

### **Do's and Don'ts:**

- ❌ **This code is bad.**
- ✅ **This code can be improved by [specific suggestion]. For example, consider using [clean code principle] to enhance readability.**

- ❌ **Your implementation is incorrect.**
- ✅ **Your implementation could be more effective by [specific suggestion]. Consider [example or resource] for best practices.**

- ❌ **This feature is unnecessary.**
- ✅ **I think this feature might not align with our goals. It could be more beneficial to focus on [alternative feature] that addresses [specific need].**

- ❌ **I don't like your approach.**
- ✅ **I believe there might be a more efficient way to approach this problem. What do you think about [alternative approach]?**

- ❌ **You always do this wrong.**
- ✅ **I've noticed this pattern before. To avoid this in the future, we could establish some guidelines or best practices.**

## 4. Contribution Values

### Encouraging Contributions

We aim to encourage less experienced developers to contribute to the project.

### Quality Guidelines

We have strict guidelines in place to ensure the quality of the project. All claims made during discussions should be backed by evidence and reasoning to demonstrate their value.

### Constructive Critique

Remember, critiques of work are not critiques of the individual. Development is a collaborative and enjoyable process. Do not take feedback personally, as it is intended to improve the project and contribute to your growth as a developer.

## 5. Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness any behavior that contradicts this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers. We take all concerns seriously and will address them appropriately.

## 6. Conclusion

By participating in Nimbus-UI, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. Together, we can create a positive and productive environment that benefits everyone involved.
