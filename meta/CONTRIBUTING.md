# Contributing to Nimbus-UI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nimbus-UI, a component library for React and Preact! Here you will find an outline of our guidelines to get you started:

## 🎓 Keywords

- **Merge Request (MR)**: A request to merge code changes.
- **Test Driven Development (TDD)**: A software development approach in which tests are written before the code.

## 🌊 Before You Dive In

1. Check our open issues. If you see an unassigned issue that interests you, leave a comment to let us know you’re interested.

2. Get in contact - Contact us [here](./CONTACT.md) for approval as a contributor.

3. Read our [Development Guidelines](./DEVELOPMENT.md) - We have various guidelines
   to help keep our project consistent and maintainable. This allows us to give many
   devs the opportunity to contribute to the project whilst ensuring maintainability
   and high quality code.

### 👀 Spotted Something Off?

Found a problem in our project? Please point it out by opening an issue in the repository. If you’d like to work on a fix, just add a message!

## ⚙️ Our Practices

### 📃 Branch Naming Conventions

We enforce naming conventions on our repository to ensure consistency among developers from various backgrounds. Our branches must follow this format: `<type>/<issue-id>/<username>/<description>`

**Example**: `feature/ISSUE-123/lukemccann/initial-commit`

Branches that do not follow this criteria will not be allowed to be pushed. If a branch does make it through but does not adhere to this standard, it will need to be renamed before merging. If you believe there is a better `<type>` for the branch name than we currently support, please feel free to submit a request for review.

### 📝 Defining Our Terms

#### 🌀 Types

- **Bugfix**: A planned correction of a software defect or error identified during testing or in production.
- **Docs**: An update or addition to documentation.
- **Feature**: A piece of fully-fledged functionality that operates independently and can be integrated with other features to enhance the overall application.
- **Hotfix**: An urgent, immediate fix for a critical issue.
- **Integration**: Adds integrations with third parties or internal APIs from other projects.
- **Refactor**: Restructuring of existing code to improve its readability, maintainability, or performance without altering its external functionality.
- **Release**: A new release version.
- **Security**: Addresses security issues or adds to the security of the project.
- **Test**: Code to verify the correctness of existing or expected functionality (includes TDD).

### ✨ Basic Contribution Workflow

1. Clone the repository and install packages.
2. Create a new branch with your fix or feature.
3. Ensure ESLint passes (`yarn run lint`).
4. Run tests before committing (`jest test`).
5. Submit a Pull Request for review.
